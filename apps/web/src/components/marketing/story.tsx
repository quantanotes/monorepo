          That's me as a broke 21 year old in San Fransisco, with dreams to
          build the next big thing. I pulled myself from the UK to SF, all
          thanks to sales.
          <br />
          <br />
          No connections, no funding - just me trying to build something. But
          most of my time wasn't spent building. It was spent chasing leads,
          emails, rescheduling meetings, updating CRMs. I felt like an assistant
          to my own job.
          <br />
          <br />
          That's why I started Quanta.

          It connects to your tools i.e. email, calendar, tasks, contacts and
          handles the repetitive stuff automatically. So you stop spending half
          your day clicking around and actually get time to focus.
